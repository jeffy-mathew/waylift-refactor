# The task

Imagine you work for a consultancy company, and one of your colleagues has been doing some work for the Tennis Society. The contract is for 10 hours billable work, and your colleague has spent 8.5 hours working on it. Unfortunately he has now fallen ill. He says he has completed the work, and **the tests all pass**. Your boss has asked you to take over from him. She wants you to **spend an hour or so on the code** so she can bill the client for the full 10 hours. **She instructs you to tidy up the code a little and perhaps make some notes so you can give your colleague some feedback on his chosen design. You should also prepare to talk to your boss about the value of this refactoring work, over and above the extra billable hours.**


# What you should do
Refactor the class "TennisGame1". You should use the language that's most familiar to you.

1. Fork the repo
1. Do not change the interface or tests.
1. Refactor the code to improve readability whil still passing tests.
1. Do not spend more than an hour or so.
1. Send us the link to your repo. Please make it private and give access to WayLit organization

The test suite provided is fairly comprehensive, and fast to run. You should not need to change the tests, only run them often as you refactor.
